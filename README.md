# AI-Search
Implementation of A*, DFS, BFS, GBFS search algorithms using JavaScript.

This project helps to understand how these algorithms work and how do they compare to each other. The program applies these algorithms to find solution of different mazes.

'I' represents the initial state/node whereas 'G' represents the goal state/node.

### Demo Instructions:
Enter Maze No: 1 OR 2 OR 3
